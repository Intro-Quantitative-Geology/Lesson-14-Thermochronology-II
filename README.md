# Lesson 14: Basics of thermochronology II
In part two of the [exercises for the final two weeks of the course](https://github.com/Intro-Quantitative-Geology/Lesson-13-Thermochronology-I/blob/master/Lesson/Lesson-13.4-Intro-to-thermochronology-overview.pdf) we will combine the thermochronometer age prediction code used last week with an age dataset from the Bhutan Himalaya to quantify the long-term rates of erosion recorded in the thermochronometer data.
These results will be presented in detail in your [final report for the course](https://github.com/Intro-Quantitative-Geology/Lesson-13-Thermochronology-I/blob/master/Lesson/Final-report.md).
